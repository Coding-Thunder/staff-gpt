# StaffGPT Frontend Guide

This README contains a complete guide to setting up the StaffGPT frontend using Next.js 14, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI, and TypeScript.

---

## 1️⃣ Project Setup

**Stack & Tools:**

* Node.js 20+
* Next.js 14 (App Router)
* TypeScript
* Redux Toolkit
* Tailwind CSS
* shadcn/ui
* Axios for API requests
* dotenv for environment variables

**Installation Steps:**

1. Create Next.js app with TypeScript.
2. Install dependencies: Redux, Axios, Tailwind, shadcn/ui.
3. Configure Tailwind (`tailwind.config.js`) to include `app/` and `components/`.

**Environment Variables:**

* `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` — Backend API URL.

## 2️⃣ Directory Structure

```
app/
├─ components/        # Reusable UI components (AgentCard, ChatWindow, ThreadList, etc.)
├─ redux/             # Redux store and slices
├─ pages/             # Next.js pages (login, dashboard, agents)
├─ services/          # API request definitions
├─ styles/            # Global CSS and Tailwind
└─ utils/             # Helper functions
```

---

## 3️⃣ Redux Setup

* Use Redux Toolkit for state management.
* Create slices for: `auth`, `agents`, `threads`, `marketplace`, `billing`.
* Configure store and provide it via `Provider` in `_app.tsx`.

---

## 4️⃣ API Integration

* Use Axios for all backend requests.
* Centralize endpoints in `services/api.ts`.
* Endpoints include login, register, agents, threads, marketplace, and billing.

---

## 5️⃣ Components Overview

* **AgentCard:** Displays agent info.
* **ChatWindow:** Shows messages per thread and allows sending messages.
* **ThreadList:** Lists all threads of an agent.
* **ProfileCard:** User profile and settings.
* **FileUpload:** Uploads files for trait parsing.

---

## 6️⃣ Pages Overview

* **index.tsx / login.tsx:** Landing and login pages.
* **dashboard.tsx:** Overview of agents, threads, and marketplace.
* **agents/[id].tsx:** Detailed agent view with chat and threads.

---

## 7️⃣ Tips & Best Practices

* Keep components modular and reusable.
* Connect Redux slices with API services cleanly.
* Use Tailwind and shadcn/ui for consistent styling.
* Separate configuration via `.env` for API URLs.
* For chat threads, keep data scalable (avoid huge arrays in memory).

---

## 8️⃣ Next Steps

1. Implement Redux slices and connect to backend endpoints.
2. Build pages and components, hooking them to Redux.
3. Integrate chat functionality with threads.
4. Connect file upload and trait parsing.
5. Integrate marketplace and agent cloning features.
6. Optional: billing and subscription views.
7. Test end-to-end with backend API.
